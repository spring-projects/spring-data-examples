    "content" : "<p>Spring Security OAuth 2.0.3 is available now in all the usual Maven repositories. It's a bug fix release, nothing major, so upgrading from 2.0.x should be painless (and is recommended). Some people were having issues getting JWT tokens to work properly, and those should be fixed. The only noteworthy functional change is that Resource Servers (if configured with <code>@Configuration</code>) will now check the validity of the client and scopes before allowing access to protected resources. This means that client privileges can be revoked quickly, but may also lead to a performance penalty (so caching the <code>ClientDetailsService</code> results would be recommended).</p>",

Time sure flies when you're having fun! The beginning of 2015 will mark the <em>4th</em> year of <em>This Week in Spring</em>, and it's more exciting every week! I'm hoping to see as many of you as possible at SpringOne2GX 2014. This is sure to be an amazing event. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, with that out of the way, let's get on to this week's roundup!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Spring Security lead Rob Winch just announced   <a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/18/spring-security-4-0-0-m2-released\"> Spring Security 4.0.0.M2</a>, which<br>\nprovides a <em>lot</em> of great features, including improved Security-aware testing support, Spring Data integration, support for websocket security, and ties into the nascent Spring Session projet that was derived from the work for this release. Check it out! Rob also announced <a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/15/cve-2014-3527-fixed-in-spring-security-3-2-5-and-3-1-7\">Spring Security 3.2.5 and 3.1.7</a> which is a fix that closes a few potential security holes. This is good stuff, all around!</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/15/spring-framework-4-1-rc2-released\">Spring framework 4.1.RC2 just dropped</a>. Spring 4.1 is <em>very</em> near completion, so be sure to check out the latest and greatest bits in this release! </li>\n<li>Christoph Strobl just announced <a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/13/first-release-candidate-of-spring-data-release-train-evans-available\"> the first RC for the Spring Data Evans release train</a>. The new release includes a lot of features, including text search integration for Spring Data MongoDB, improved multistore support, configuration options for Redis sentinels, and much more.</li>\n<li>Our friends at Codecentric have just announced a new cut of their <a href=\"http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/08/spring-boot-starter-batch-web-1-2-0-released/\">custom Spring Boot autoconfiguration for Spring Batch</a>.   This implementation is different   than the auto-configuration provided out of the box with Spring Boot, and includes support for JSR 352.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Netflix Developer Dan Woods recently gave a nice talk looking at what they hope <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/danveloper/future-of-grails\"> to get out of the Spring Boot-based Grails 3</a>, and the slide deck is definitely worth a look.</li>\n<li>The Being Java Guys blog has a nice post on  how to build a REST service with Spring 4 and Hibernate 4. The example uses <code>web.xml</code> and Spring XML configuration. It's a working recipe, but I hope readers will remember that you <a href=\"http://www.beingjavaguys.com/2014/08/spring-restful-web-services.html\"> can get the same done with Spring Boot in <em>much</em> less time</a> and code.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/wls/SPRNG/intro.htm#BHCDGJFA\">Oracle has particular support for Spring-based applications in WebLogic 12.1.3</a> which, I confess, I didn't know about.

    "title" : "Building a RESTful quotation service with Spring",
    "content" : "<p>I was recently made aware that a public API we were using for one of our guides contained objectionable material. After confirming this, I immediately responded that we would pick another source. Wishing to avoid such an issue in the future, I decided the best solution was to build our own RESTful quote service. So I decided to use the best tools to do so, the Spring stack, and was able to migrate the very next day.</p>\n\n<h3>\n<a name=\"user-content-picking-your-tools\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#picking-your-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Picking your tools</h3>\n\n<p>To kick things off, I made a check list of what I knew would be the right tools for the job of creating a RESTful web service.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/\">Spring Data JPA</a> - quickly pre-load, fetch, and potentially update content</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/\">Spring MVC</a> - solid REST support since Spring 3</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/\">Spring Boot</a> - create all the needed components with little to no effort</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://start.spring.io\">http://start.spring.io</a> - assemble a project by simply checking the desired items on a form</li>\n</ul><p>I quickly set aside the desire to add, delete, manage, or view the data through a web page. Instead, my focus was to serve up a fixed set of content with the exact same structure that the guide expected to consume.</p>\n\n<h3>\n<a name=\"user-content-picking-your-content\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#picking-your-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Picking your content</h3>\n\n<p>The original content for the guide was a series of \"Chunk Norris\" jokes. I like a good laugh. But when I revisited the public API, I saw that several of the jokes were a bit rancid. After a brief discussion with colleagues, the idea came up to cite historical quotes. I took that idea and bent it a little. I had recently collected quotes from various developers about Spring Boot for personal reasons, so I decided to use that as the curated content.</p>\n\n<h3>\n<a name=\"user-content-time-to-code\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#time-to-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Time to code!</h3>\n\n<p>To kick things off, I visited <a href=\"http://start.spring.io\">http://start.spring.io</a>. This <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-io/initializr\">Spring Boot app</a> lets you enter the details of your new project, pick the Java level, and select the Spring Boot starters you need. I used my checklist up above and created a new gradle-based project.</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a name=\"user-content-defining-your-domain\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#defining-your-domain\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Defining your domain</h4>\n\n<p>With the project unpacked and imported into my IDE, the first thing I did was copy the <a href=\"http://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-reactor/#initial\">domain objects shown in the Reactor guide</a>. This way, I could ensure that the data sent out by my REST service was correct. Since the POJOs in my <em>Quoters Incorporated</em> app are almost identical, I won't post them here.</p>\n\n<p>Then I created a Spring Data repository.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"nc\">QuoteRepository</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"n\">CrudRepository</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Quote</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Long</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This empty interface definition handles <code>Quote</code> objects with an internal primary key of type <code>Long</code>. By extending the Spring Data Commons <code>CrudRepository</code>, it inherits a fistful of database operations we'll use later on.</p>\n\n<p>Next step? Initialize some data.

The results are turned into a <code>List</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To fetch a single quote, it first tests if a given id exists. If not, return <code>NONE</code>. Otherwise, return a wrapped quote.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to fetch a random quote, I use Java 8's <code>Random</code> utility inside the <code>nextLong()</code> utility method to fetch a <code>Long</code> with the <code>lowerRange</code> and <code>upperRange</code>, inclusively.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why am I using <code>QuoteResource</code>? <code>Quote</code> is the core domain object returned by the <code>QuoteRepository</code>. To match the previous public API, I wrap each instance in a <code>QuoteResource</code> which includes a <strong>status</strong> code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>\n<a name=\"user-content-testing-the-results\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#testing-the-results\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Testing the results</h4>\n\n<p>With this in place, the default <code>Application</code> class created by <a href=\"http://start.spring.io\">http://start.spring.io</a> was ready to run.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ curl localhost:8080/api/random\n{\n    type: \"success\",\n    value: {\n        id: 1,\n        quote: \"Working with Spring Boot is like pair-programming with the Spring developers.\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ta dah! </p>\n\n<p>To wrap things up, I built the JAR file and pushed it up to <a href=\"https://run.pivotal.io/\">Pivotal Web Services</a>.

    "content" : "<p>Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>. We've got a <em>lot</em> of cool stuff happening and, as you might imagine, the entire team is abuzz in preparation for SpringOne2GX 2014, coming in just a few short weeks! If you haven't registered, <a href=\"http://springone2gx.com\">now's the time to do so</a>!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Spring Security lead and all-around sleepless ninja Rob Winch has just announced that Spring MVC Test HtmlUnit 1.0.0.M2 has been released. This is an <em>awesome</em> release if you're trying to <a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/06/spring-mvc-test-htmlunit-1-0-0-m2-released\">unit test real pages with Spring MVC</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/07/spring-boot-1-1-5-released\">Spring Boot 1.1.5 has just been released</a>. The new release mainly addresses a few issues and is a recommended upgrade for all users.</li>\n<li>I really enjoyed this blog, <a href=\"http://www.genbetadev.com/frameworks/que-es-spring-framework\">¿Qué es Spring Framework?</a>, which tries to explain what the fundamental value of Spring is. Largely, the (Spanish language) article explains that Spring handles the lifecycle for objects in a consistent way. It's easy to plug in various frameworks, software, around the edges when the fundamental life-cycle is handled. I would point out that this post uses Spring 3.0 and XML configuration, which is a bit outdated, though certainly still works. </li>\n<li>The RebelLabs folks are back at it with an interesting look at web framework usage. Check out this <a href=\"http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/top-4-java-web-frameworks-revealed-real-life-usage-data-of-spring-mvc-vaadin-gwt-and-jsf/\">latest report which has Spring MVC leading </a>  the charge (by a lot).</li>\n<li>This is a nice post looking at how to use Spring MVC (as part of Spring framework 4.x) to <a href=\"http://www.concretepage.com/spring-4/spring-4-mvc-single-multiple-file-upload-example-with-tomcat\">handle file uploads</a>\n</li>\n<li>The <em>Mr. Haki * blog has a nice post <a href=\"http://mrhaki.blogspot.com/2014/08/gradle-goodness-getting-more-dependency.html\">on analyzing dependencies using Gradle</a>, with an example based on Spring Boot. <a href=\"http://start.spring.io\">Spring Boot, of course, is easy to get started with</a>, can be used with Maven *or</em> Gradle, and has numerous benefits, not the least of which being that it makes it dead simple to use Spring libraries in your project without worrying about version mismatches. </li>\n<li> Stuck on JAX-RS and JSF? Still want to use Spring Security? This post - <a href=\"http://ezjsf.blogspot.com/2014/08/javaee-rest-jax-rs-with-spring-security.html\">from the JSF Usefullness post</a> - has the code snippets that (sort of) demonstrate a path forward. Granted, you'll have an easier time of doing this using straight Spring. No need to add all that extra Java EE weight.. </li>\n<li> This is a sort of oldie-but-a-goodie: a post on how to <a href=\"http://www.technicalkeeda.com/spring/jquery-ajax-autosave-example-in-spring-mvc\">implement a JQuery-powered autosave example in Spring MVC</a>\n</li>\n<li> This is a (particularly tortured) example of <a href=\"http://www.mastertheboss.com/spring/spring-jdbc-application-on-wildfly\">how to write a Spring application that uses Primefaces and runs on the Wildfly application server</a>. I don't see why you'd need all this indirection when Spring has good JSF support out of the box. Additionally, there's no reason to recreate the <code>JdbcTemplate</code> or inject an <code>ApplicationContext</code> into a bean. Maybe it'll help somebody as a first-cut, though. </li>\n</ol><p>So, did I mention <strong>SpringOne2GX 2014</strong>? It's right around the corner! I'll be there, <a href=\"http://spring.io/team\">and so will everyone from the Spring team</a>, so don't miss out. This is going to be an amazing year. I happen to know what some of the keynotes are going to be about. Do <em>not</em> miss out. <a href=\"http://springone2gx.com\">Register today</a>!</p>",

    "title" : "Extending Spring Cloud",
    "content" : "<p>One of the most interesting capabilities of Spring Cloud is its extensibility. You can extend it to support additional clouds, enhance already supported clouds, support new services, new service connectors--all without modifying the Spring Cloud code itself. In this blog, we explore this capability. If you haven’t done so already, please read the <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2014/06/03/introducing-spring-cloud\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/29/using-spring-cloud-programmatically\">second</a> blog in this series to acquire sufficient background.</p>\n\n<h1>\n<a name=\"user-content-the-three-axes-of-extensibility\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-three-axes-of-extensibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>The three axes of extensibility</h1>\n\n<p>Spring Cloud provides extensibility along three orthogonal directions. You may extend it in one of these directions and orthogonality ensures that you continue to benefit from the others.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Cloud Platforms</strong>: While Spring Cloud supports Cloud Foundry, Heroku, and a Local Config cloud (to test locally in a cloud-like environment), you aren’t limited by these choices. You can add your own cloud platform and take advantage of the rest of Spring Cloud capability such as Spring Java Config.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cloud Services</strong>: Cloud platforms offer a variety of services ranging from relational databases to messaging. Services offered by each cloud platform vary a lot, even for multiple installations of the same platform. This is especially true for PaaS offerings such as Cloud Foundry, where private instances of Cloud Foundry tend to have services specific to each installation. Spring Cloud offers an easy way to extend to services beyond its core offering. Just like cloud platform extensibility, you don’t have to change Spring Cloud code to extend it to new services and you continue to take advantage of the other parts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Frameworks</strong>: Spring Cloud currently supports Spring frameworks through the <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud/tree/main/spring-cloud-spring-service-connector\">spring-service-connector</a> module. However, except for that module, nothing in Spring Cloud depends on Spring. As such, you should be able to either use other parts from any JVM-based framework or extend it for a framework by adding a new module.</p></li>\n</ol><p>In the <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/29/using-spring-cloud-programmatically\">previous blog</a>, we looked at how you would use <code>CloudFactory</code> and <code>Cloud</code> to programmatically use Spring Cloud. When it comes to extensibility, you will not be working with either of these; instead you will implement other types in the core module. Let’s take a look at them.</p>\n\n<h1>\n<a name=\"user-content-cloud-platform-extensibility\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cloud-platform-extensibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Cloud Platform Extensibility</h1>\n\n<p>The main type you will need to be familiar with to extend Spring Cloud to a new cloud platform is <code>CloudConnector</code>, which is a simple three-method interface:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"nc\">CloudConnector</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">boolean</span> <span class=\"nf\">isInMatchingCloud</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">ApplicationInstanceInfo</span> <span class=\"nf\">getApplicationInstanceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">ServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"nf\">getServiceInfos</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The <code>isInMatchingCloud()</code> method should examine its environment to decide if it is operating in the right environment. For example, the Cloud Foundry connector checks the existence of the <code>VCAP_APPLICATION</code> environment variable, whereas the Heroku connector looks for the existence of the <code>DYNO</code> environment variable. The <code>getApplicationInstanceInfo()</code> method returns information about the current application instance (app name, host, port, and application properties). The most interesting method <code>getServiceInfos()</code> returns a list with each element containing enough information so that applications know how to connect to each service. Exact information contained in each <code>ServiceInfo</code> object is left up to each implementation (the <code>ServiceInfo</code> as such defines only one method: <code>getId()</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Once you create an implementation of <code>CloudConnector</code>, you need to make Spring Cloud aware of it. For all extension points, Spring Cloud uses a uniform mechanism based on <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html\">ServiceLoader</a>. As applied to Spring Cloud for platform extensibility, it boils down to including a file named <code>/META-INF/services/org.springframework.cloud.CloudConnector</code> with an entry with the fully-qualified name of the implementation class. Typically, you will bundle this file along with your implementation and supporting classes. Then all an app has to do is include this jar on the classpath.</p>\n\n<h1>\n<a name=\"user-content-service-extensibility\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#service-extensibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Service Extensibility</h1>\n\n<p>The <code>ServiceInfoCreator</code> interface provides an extension point to work with a new service.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"nc\">ServiceInfoCreator</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">SI</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"n\">ServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SD</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kt\">boolean</span> <span class=\"nf\">accept</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">SD</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceData</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"n\">SI</span> <span class=\"nf\">createServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">SD</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceData</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The generic parameter <code>SI</code> defines the kind of <code>ServiceInfo</code> it will create, whereas the <code>SD</code> parameter defines the raw service data type it can work with. The raw service data type depends on the cloud platform. For example, in Cloud Found, it will be a <code>Map</code> based on the <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable, whereas in Heroku, it will be a pair containing the service-specific environment variables and its value. Since the raw data type depends on the platform, so does implementations of <code>ServiceInfoCreator</code>. The <code>accept()</code> method examines the service data and determines if it can deal with it. For example, it can look at the URL scheme and determine if it can consume that service data. If it can, the <code>createServiceInfo()</code> must return a <code>ServiceInfo</code> object. If it is a completely new service, you may also have to implement <code>ServiceInfo</code> for that, else you can use one of the existing ones.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have implemented a <code>ServiceInfoCreator</code>, you will have to let Spring Cloud know about it. This follows the same idea as discussed earlier for cloud platform extensibility. In this case, the file name you use is <code>CloudConnector</code> dependent. For Cloud Foundry, it is  <code>/META-INF/services/org.springframework.cloud.cloudfoundry.CloudFoundryServiceInfoCreator</code>  (theoretically, a <code>CloudConnector</code> implementation may decide to use another extension mechanism, but Spring Cloud doesn’t recommend that).</p>\n\n<p>As discussed in the previous blog, a cloud app developer may decide to work directly with a <code>ServiceInfo</code> object. As such, if you just implement a <code>ServiceInfoCreator</code>, you would have provided some benefit already. However, working with a raw <code>ServiceInfo</code> object may not be appreciated by many developers focused on developing apps, so you will implement the next extension as well.</p>\n\n<h1>\n<a name=\"user-content-framework-extensibility\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#framework-extensibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Framework Extensibility</h1>\n\n<p>The last extensibility point is <code>ServiceConnectorCreator</code>. Its job is to transform <code>ServiceInfo</code> into a service connector that is suitable for consumption in the framework the app is using. For example, it could transform <code>MysqlServiceInfo</code> into a <code>DataSource</code> object. Out of the box, Spring Cloud supports connectors for <code>DataSource</code> and a few <a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-data\">Spring Data</a> and <a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-amqp\">Spring AMQP</a> types. If you wish to extend Spring Cloud to other frameworks or if you wanted to support other Spring Data types (such as Neo4J, Elasticsearch, Cassandra) or Spring-compatible types (such as S3) not yet supported directly by Spring Cloud, this is the extension point you need.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"nc\">ServiceConnectorCreator</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">SC</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SI</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"n\">ServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">SC</span> <span class=\"nf\">create</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">SI</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">ServiceConnectorConfig</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceConnectorConfig</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>There are a couple more methods; however, you will normally extend the <code>AbstractServiceConnectorCreator</code> that takes care of implementing those. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>SC</code> generic parameter to <code>ServiceConnectorCreator</code> is bound to the type of connector it will create, such as <code>DataSource</code>, whereas the <code>SI</code> parameter signifies the type of <code>ServiceInfo</code> it can work with.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>create()</code> method is supplied with a <code>ServiceInfo</code> object and a configuration object, that carries service-specific info such as pooling parameters.

I.. tried... but couldn't find anything wrong with this. If you understand those two slides, then you have enough to make the case for Cloud Foundry. Obviously, these aren't implementation instructions so much as  a  darned good first step at making the business case. Why Cloud Foundry for you and me? Because it's a perfect platform to run Spring-based workloads. There. That probably wouldn't even have needed a whole slide. :)</li>\n</ol>",

    "content" : "<p>Speakers: Josh Long and Joram Barrez, Activiti </p>\n\n<p>Today's applications are complex, distributed systems that - taken together - produce results. Tracking the flow of work through that system, however, becomes increasingly more painful as automated- and human-driven tasks are integrated into business processes. Business can't react to what it can't see. Business can't measure what it can't see. \"Workflow\" describes the sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. Workflow systems, like Activiti, describe and then execute these processes. Activiti is an open-source, Apache 2-licensed workflow engine that works with Spring and Spring Boot.  In this webinar, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long and Activiti-ninja Joram Barrez for a look at how to distill, describe and reuse complex business processes using Spring (and Spring Boot) and Activiti. </p>\n\n<p>Tuesday, Sept 23rd, 2014 3:00PM BST (London UTC+01:00) <a href=\"http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_ProcessDrivenSpringAppsActiviti7AM_Register.html\">Register</a></p>\n\n<p>Tuesday, Sept 23rd, 2014 10:00 am Pacific Daylight Time (San Francisco, UTC-07:00) <a href=\"http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_ProcessDrivenSpringAppsActiviti10AM_Register.html\">Register</a></p>",

In broad strokes, Microservices offer a refreshed approach to application architecture. Microservices are a new way to describe many of the patterns that have fallen out of large-scale applications in practice over the recent years. There is no doubt that the approach works.

    "title" : "Using Spring Cloud programmatically",
    "content" : "<p>In the <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2014/06/03/introducing-spring-cloud\">last blog</a>, I showed you how to use <a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud\">Spring Cloud</a>'s Java configuration option to obtain service connectors declaratively (there is also XML namespace support, if you need it). In this blog, we will take a closer look at how you would use Spring Cloud programmatically. This will help in the situations where you cannot use Java or XML configuration. It will also demystify how Spring Cloud works and prepare for the next blog in this series, where we discuss extending Spring Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>To work with Spring Cloud we need to access an object of the <code>Cloud</code> class. However, you can’t create a <code>Cloud</code> object directly (its constructor is not public). Instead, you will obtain it through <code>CloudFactory</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"n\">CloudFactory</span> <span class=\"n\">cloudFactory</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nf\">CloudFactory</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Cloud</span> <span class=\"n\">cloud</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cloudFactory</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getCloud</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The cloud object created in this matter is suitable for the environment in which the app is operating. For example, if the app is running in Cloud Foundry it is configured to understand how it exposes services to the app. Note that creating a <code>CloudFactory</code> instance is somewhat expensive, therefore you should try to avoid creating multiple instances. If you use a dependency injection framework such as Spring, it will take care of avoiding multiple instances; otherwise, just manage it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Once we have the cloud object, we can get application instance information, service information objects using various criteria, and service connectors using the specified criteria. Let's say, you want to get <code>ServiceInfo</code> objects for all services bound to the app and print the JDBC URL for relational services, you could use the following snippet:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">ServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceInfos</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cloud</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getServiceInfos</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ServiceInfo</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceInfo</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceInfos</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">serviceInfo</span> <span class=\"k\">instanceof</span> <span class=\"n\">RelationalServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">out</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">println</span><span class=\"o\">(((</span><span class=\"n\">RelationalServiceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">).</span><span class=\"na\">getJdbcUrl</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This will produce output such as this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jdbc:postgresql://babar.elephantsql.com:5432/tbsonrjm?user=***&amp;password=***\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Objects obtained using <code>getServiceInfos()</code> and its variations contain enough information such as URL and credentials to create a service connector. In some cases, obtaining a <code>ServiceInfo</code> object may be all you need, since you can always create suitable connectors (such as a <code>DataSource</code>) based on it. But in most cases, you would let Spring Cloud create a suitable service connector for a service. For example, if you would like to get a <code>DataSource</code> for the \"inventory-db\" service directly, you could use the following snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DataSource inventoryDataSource = \n    cloud.getServiceConnector(\"inventory-db\", DataSource.class, null);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is a variation of this method: <code>getSingletonServiceConnector()</code>, which you can use as follows:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"n\">DataSource</span> <span class=\"n\">inventoryDataSource</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cloud</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getSingletonServiceConnector</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">DataSource</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"kc\">null</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Here, it will return a <code>DataSource</code> for the unique relational database service bound to the app; if there is no such service or there is more than one service, it will throw an exception. We passed <code>null</code> as the last argument to both methods to use the default configuration for the created connector. However, you can pass a configuration you desire to override. For example, here we specify pool config as well as connection config for the datasource to be created.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"n\">PoolConfig</span> <span class=\"n\">poolConfig</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nf\">PoolConfig</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">200</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n<span class=\"n\">ConnectionConfig</span> <span class=\"n\">connectionConfig</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nf\">ConnectionConfig</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"characterEncoding=UTF-8\"</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n<span class=\"n\">DataSourceConfig</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceConfig</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nf\">DataSourceConfig</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">poolConfig</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">connectionConfig</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n<span class=\"n\">DataSource</span> <span class=\"n\">invetoryDataSource</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cloud</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getSingletonServiceConnector</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">DataSource</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">class</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">serviceConfig</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Last, there is a method to obtain application info that contains application id (cloud dependent, but typically the application name), application instance id, and loosely defined application properties. Let’s print all this information:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-java\"><pre><span class=\"n\">ApplicationInstanceInfo</span> <span class=\"n\">appInstanceInfo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cloud</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getApplicationInstanceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n<span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">out</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">println</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Application id: \"</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">appInstanceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getAppId</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n<span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">out</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">println</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Application instance id: \"</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">appInstanceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getInstanceId</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Map</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">Entry</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">String</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Object</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"nl\">entry:</span> <span class=\"n\">appInstanceInfo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getProperties</span><span class=\"o\">().</span><span class=\"na\">entrySet</span><span class=\"o\">())</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">out</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">println</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Application property: \"</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">entry</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getKey</span><span class=\"o\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"s\">\"=\"</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">entry</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getValue</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>When you execute this code in an app running in Cloud Foundry, you get output similar to the following (abbreviated here). If the same app is running in Heroku, it will produce a similar output, however, with a different set of keys:</p>\n\n<pre>\nApplication id: hello-spring-cloud\nApplication instance id: 8b523252a9d3478b92750ef27ad4e5b0\nApplication property: limits={mem=800, disk=1024, fds=16384}\nApplication property: application_version=b1257c57-2a5c-47aa-8ca7-5e8b6d9a7b9c\nApplication property: application_name=hello-spring-cloud\nApplication property: application_uris=[hello-spring-cloud.cfapps.io]\nApplication property: version=b1257c57-2a5c-47aa-8ca7-5e8b6d9a7b9c\nApplication property: name=hello-spring-cloud\nApplication property: space_name=development\nApplication property: space_id=5f629937-1821-4f48-9eb4-8c67c70c0df0\nApplication property: application_id=a345f90f-e075-4005-b003-f4ab86ad716a\nApplication property: instance_id=8b523252a9d3478b92750ef27ad4e5b0\nApplication property: instance_index=0\nApplication property: host=0.0.0.0\nApplication property: port=61023\nApplication property: start=2014-07-15 21:27:34 +0000\nApplication property: state_timestamp=1405459654\n</pre>\n\n<p>That is pretty much all you need to know to use Spring Cloud programmatically. In the next blog, we will shift our focus on the extensibility aspect of Spring Cloud. Stay tuned.</p>",
